From a server perspective, `vite-plugin-ssr` is simply a server middleware.

```js
const { createPageRender } = require('vite-plugin-ssr')

// On the server-side, `vite-plugin-ssr` is simply a `renderPage()` function.
const renderPage = createPageRender()

// `app` can be any server framework such as Express.js/Fastify/Koa/Hapi/...
app.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  // We can also use `renderPage()` in a serverless environment such as Cloudflare Workers
  const result = await renderPage({ url: req.url })
  res.send(result.renderResult)
})
```

Not only can we use `vite-plugin-ssr` with any server environment we want (Cloudflare Workers, EC2 instance, AWS lambda, Firebase, Express.js, Fastify, Hapi, ...),
but we can also use any server tool we want, for example any authentication strategy & tool (email/password, OAuth, Passport.js, Grant, Auth0, ...).
