### DX Scalability with Lazy-transpiling

Vite does lazy-transpiling: only code requested by the browser is transpiled.
This means that if you define 10 pages but load only one page in the browser, then only the code that is needed to render that page is transpiled.

Thanks to Vite's lazy-transpiling approach, you can scale to (very!) large source code while with a dev speed and HMR that stays fast.

### Scalable SSR Architecture

As you scale you may need increasinlgy precise SSR needs; `vite-plugin-ssr` is designed to be flexible for even highly custom SSR needs.

You can even, at very large scale, progressively replace `vite-plugin-ssr` with Vite's native SSR API which is a low level and robust (many projects, such as `vite-plugin-ssr`, and many companies are built on top of and depend on it). If you are Netflix and squeezing out each UX imperfection leads to a substantial revenue increase, then `vite-plugin-ssr` and/or Vite's SSR API are what you are looking for.
