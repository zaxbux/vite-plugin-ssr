import { RepoLink } from '../components/RepoLink'

With `vite-plugin-ssr`, we have full control over rendering, which means that integrating tools is simply a matter of following the official SSR guide of the tool we want to use.

RPC:
 - [Wildcard API - SSR](https://github.com/brillout/wildcard-api#ssr)

GraphQL:
 - [Apollo GraphQL - Server-side rendering](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/server-side-rendering/)
 - [Relay - SSR docs #3468](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/3468#issuecomment-824872147)

While we can follow the official guides *exactly* as-is and serialize the initial state into HTML,
we can also leverage `addPageContext()` with `passToClient` to make our life slightly easier
as shown in the following example.
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/graphql-apollo/' />
