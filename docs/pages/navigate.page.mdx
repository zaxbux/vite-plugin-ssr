import { RepoLink } from './components/RepoLink'

Environment: `Browser`. (In `Node.js` we can import `navigate()` but not call it.)

We can use `navigate('/some-url')` to programmatically navigate our user to another page (i.e. when navigation isn't triggered by the user clicking on an anchor tag `<a>`).
For example, we can redirect our user after a successful form submission.

```jsx
import { navigate } from "vite-plugin-ssr/client/router";

// Some deeply nested view component
function Form() {
   return (
     <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
       {/* ... */}
     </form>
   );
}

async function onSubmit() {
  /* ...  */

  const navigationPromise = navigate('/form/success');

  console.log("The URL changed but the new page hasn't rendered yet.");
  await navigationPromise
  console.log("The new page has finished rendering.");
}
```

If you want to redirect your user at page-load time, see the [Page Redirection](/page-redirection) guide instead.

Options:
 - `navigate('/some-url', { keepScrollPosition: true })`: Do not scroll to the top of the page; keep scroll position where it is instead. (Useful for [Nested Routes](routing#nested-routes).) (We can also use `<a href="/some-url" keep-scroll-position />`.)

Vue example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/index.page.vue' />

React example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/index.page.tsx' />
