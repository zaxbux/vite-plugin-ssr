import { RepoLink } from './components/RepoLink'

With `vite-plugin-ssr`, we have full control over rendering, which means that integrating tools is simply a matter of following the official SSR guide of the tool we want to use.

- [Vuex - SSR Guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html#data-store)
- [PullState - SSR Example](https://lostpebble.github.io/pullstate/docs/quick-example-server-rendered)
- [Redux - SSR Recipe](https://redux.js.org/recipes/server-rendering)

While we can follow the official guides *exactly* as-is and serialize the initial state into HTML,
we can also leverage `addPageContext()` with `passToClient` to make our life slightly easier
as shown in the following examples.

 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vuex/' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/redux/' />
