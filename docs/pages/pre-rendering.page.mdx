> **What is pre-rendering?**
> Pre-rendering means to render the HTML of all our pages at build-time:
> normally, the HTML of a page is rendered at request-time
> (when the user navigates to that page) but,
> with pre-rendering, the HTML of a page is rendered at build-time instead.
>
> Our app then consists only of static files (HTML, JS, CSS, images, ...)
> that we can deploy to so-called "static hosts" such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
> If we don't use pre-rendering, then we need to use a Node.js server to be able to render our pages' HTML at request-time.

To pre-render our pages, we use the [CLI command `prerender`](/command-prerender) at the end of the build:
 - npm: `$ npx vite build && npx vite build --ssr && npx vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.
 - Yarn: `$ yarn vite build && yarn vite build --ssr && yarn vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.

After running `$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender`, all static assets are available at `dist/client/`

For pages with a parameterized route (e.g. `/movie/:movieId`), we have to use the [`prerender()` hook](/prerender) and provide a list of URLs that are to be pre-rendered.

We can also use the `prerender()` hook to accelerate the pre-rendering process as it allows us to prefetch data for multiple pages at once.

React Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)

Vue Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
