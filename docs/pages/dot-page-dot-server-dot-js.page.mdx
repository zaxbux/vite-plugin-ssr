Environment: `Node.js`<br/>
[Ext Glob](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#extglobs): `/**/*.page.server.*([a-zA-Z0-9])`

A `.page.server.js` file exports the following:
- `export { addPageContext }`
- `export { passToClient }`
- `export { render }`
- `export { prerender }`

The `.page.server.js` file is lazy-loaded: it is loaded only when needed which means that if no URL request were to match the page's route then `.page.server.js` is not loaded in your Node.js process' memory.

The `.page.server.js` file is always executed in Node.js.
