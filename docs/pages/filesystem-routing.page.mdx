By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does Filesystem Routing: the URL of a page is determined based on where its `.page.js` file is located.

```
FILESYSTEM                        URL              COMMENT
pages/about.page.js               /about
pages/index/index.page.js         /                (`index` is mapped to the empty string)
pages/HELLO.page.js               /HELLO           (Mapping is case sensitive)
```

In the above example, the common ancestor directory `pages/` is considered the URL root `/`.

The common ancestor directory doesn't have to be `pages/`; we can save our `.page.js` files wherever we want. For example:

```
FILESYSTEM                        URL
user/list.page.js                 /user/list
user/create.page.js               /user/create
todo/list.page.js                 /todo/list
todo/create.page.js               /todo/create
```

We can also move our page files in a `src/` directory.

```
FILESYSTEM                        URL
src/pages/index.page.js           /
src/pages/about.page.js           /about
```

The common ancestor directory is then `src/pages/`.

For more control over routing, we can define Route Strings or Route Functions in [`.page.route.js`](/.page.route.js) files.
