## Server-side Routing VS Client-side Routing

We can choose between two routing strategies:
 - Server-side Routing (for a simpler architecture)
 - Client-side Routing (for faster and animated page transitions)

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server-side Routing,
which is the "old school" way of doing routing: when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the browser completely loads the new page.

If you don't have a strong rationale for doing something differently, then stick to Server-side Routing as it leads to an inherently simpler architecture.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for Client-side Routing and you can opt-in by using:
 - [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter)

With Client-side Routing,
instead of doing a full HTML re-load upon page navigation,
only minimal DOM changes are applied.

Client-side Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Custom animated page transitions.

But Client-side Routing leads to an inherently more complex architecture,
which is why we recommend that you use Client-side Routing only if you
have a strong rationale.

## Filesystem Routing VS Route Strings VS Route Functions

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Filesystem Routing:

```
FILESYSTEM                  URL
pages/index.page.js         /
pages/about.page.js         /about
pages/faq/index.page.js     /faq
```

For more control over the routing we can create `.page.route.js` files.

For example, we can define a parameterized route by exporting a *Route String*:

```js
// /pages/product.page.route.js

// The `productId` value is available at `pageContext.routeParams.productId`
export default '/product/:productId'
```

For full programmatic flexibility, we can define a Route Function.

```js
// /pages/admin.page.route.js

// Route Functions allow us to implement advanced routing such as route guards.
export default (pageContext) => {
  const { url } = pageContext
  if (url === '/admin' && pageContext.user.isAdmin) {
    return { match: true }
  }
}
```

 - [API - `*.page.route.js`](/.page.route.js)

## Vue Router / React Router

We can use a routing library such as Vue Router and React Router (in complete replacement or in combination):
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-router/' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-router/' />

## Active Links

To highlight the currently selected route (e.g. if you look at the sidebar of this website you'll see the "Routing" navigation link highlighted in gray) we usually need to access [`pageContext.urlPathname`](/pageContext) in our navigation link component.
 - See [access `pageContext` anywhere](/data-fetching#access-pagecontext-anywhere).
 - We may have to add it to `passToClient.push('urlPathname')` (more infos about `passToClient` in the [Data Fetching Guide](/data-fetching))

We can then simply `const isActive = href===urlPathname` in our link component and then add a CSS class `<a class="is-active">`.

## Nested Routes

A nested route (aka sub route) is, essentially, when you have a route with multiple parameters,
for example `/product/:productId/:productView`.

```
URL                        productId     productView
/product/1337              1337          null
/product/1337/pricing      1337          pricing
/product/42/reviews        42            reviews
```

We can define a Route String or Route Function that has multiple parameters.

```js
// product.page.route.js

export default `/product/:productId/:productView`
```

```js
// product.page.route.js

// We can also use a Route Function
export default (pageContext) => {
  const { url } = pageContext
  if (!url.startsWith('/product/')) return false
  const [productId, productView] = url.split('/').slice(2)
  return { match: true, routeParams: { productId, productView } }
}
```

Usually, the sub route is used for navigating some (deeply) nested view:

```
/product/42/pricing                   /product/42/reviews
+------------------+                  +-----------------+
| Product          |                  | Product         |
| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |
| | Pricing      | |  +------------>  | | Reviews     | |
| |              | |                  | |             | |
| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |
+------------------+                  +-----------------+
```

> If your sub routes don't need URLs (the Product Pricing page and the Product Reviews page share the same URL `/product/42`), then you can simply use a stateful component instead. (When the user clicks on a "pricing" link, the stateful component changes its internal state `productView` to `'pricing'` to show the pricing view.)

By default,
`vite-plugin-ssr` does [Server-side Routing](#server-side-routing-vs-client-side-routing) instead,
which means that when the user navigates from `/product/42/pricing` to `/product/42/reviews`,
the old page `/product/42/pricing` is fully replaced with the new page `/product/42/reviews`,
leading to a jittery experience.

For smoother navigations, we can use [Client-side Routing](/useClientRouter).

```js
// product.page.client.js

import { useClientRouter } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/client/router'

// We use Client-side Routing so that, when the user navigates from `/product/42/pricing`
// to `/product/42/reviews`, only the relevant (deeply) nested view is updated (instead of
// a full HTML reload).

// Note that we override `_default.page.client.js`. This means all our other pages can use
// Server-side Routing while this page uses Client-side Routing.
// (If we already use `useClientRouter()` in `_default.page.client.js`, then we don't need to
// create this `product.page.client.js` file.)

useClientRouter({
  render(pageContext) {
    /* ... */
  }
})
```

We can then use `<a href="/product/42/reviews" keep-scroll-position />` / `navigate('/product/42/reviews', { keepScrollPosition: true })` to avoid the browser to scroll to the top upon navigation.

Alternatively,
we can use a Route String Wildcard (e.g. `/product/:params*`) and then use a routing library (Vue Router, React Router, ...) for that page,
but we recommend the aforementioned solution instead as it is simpler.
