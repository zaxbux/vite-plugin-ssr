With `vite-plugin-ssr` we can create:
 - SSR pages
 - SPA pages (aka MPA)
 - HTML pages (zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript)

For example, we can render an admin panel as SPA while rendering marketing pages to HTML-only.

The rule of thumb is to render a page to:
 - HTML (zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript), if the page has no interactivity (technically speaking: if the page has no stateful component). Example: blog, non-interactive marketing pages.
 - SPA, if the page has interactivity and doesn't need SEO (e.g. the page doesn't need to appear on Google). Example: admin panel, desktop-like web app.
 - SSR, if the page has interactivity and needs SEO (the page needs to rank high on Google). Example: social news website, interactive marketing pages.

To render a page as SPA, we simply render HTML that is static:

```js
// .page.server.js
// Environment: Node.js

import { html } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'

export function render() {
  // `div#app-root` is empty; the HTML is static.
  return html`<html>
    <head>
      <title>My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app-root"/>
    </body>
  </html>`
}
```

To render a page to HTML-only, we simply define an empty `.page.client.js`:

```js
// .page.client.js
// Environment: Browser

// We leave this empty; there is no browser-side JavaScript.

// We can still include CSS
import './path/to/some.css'
```
